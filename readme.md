# Arcon-API-Integrator

Arcon-API-Integrator is a **Postman-style API testing and management tool** designed to run seamlessly as both a **web application** and a **cross-platform desktop application**. Built with **React** for the frontend, **Express.js** for the backend, and **Electron.js** to enable native desktop support, the app enables developers to create, manage, and send HTTP requests efficiently.

Key features include:

- Import/export of API collections in JSON format.
- Request builder interface for configuring HTTP methods, headers, body, etc.
- Execution of API requests with real-time response viewing.
- Persistent storage of collections and requests.
- On desktop, collections are saved to the local file system using Node.js.
- On web, collections are stored using IndexedDB, ensuring compatibility across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave, etc.).
- Cross-platform compatibility via Electron: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Offline capability — no hosted database is required.

This tool is ideal for developers who need a lightweight, local-first alternative to cloud-based API clients, with the flexibility to run in both web and desktop environments.

Steps to use:
- Download and unzip the application package for your platform (Windows/Linux/macOS).
- Inside the extracted folder, run the installer or executable.
- On Windows: Double-click Arcon-API-Integrator.exe.
- On macOS/Linux: Run the Arcon-API-Integrator binary or use the terminal.

Steps to authenticate:

**Enjoy your API Testing.✨✨**
